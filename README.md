## Instruction

This website is built using [Docusaurus 3](https://v3.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator. 

This is our first web development, and it is because of the following open-source project that we have our own website.

-   [refine](https://refine.dev/)
-   [apisix](https://apisix.apache.org/)

This is our official website [iofomo](https://www.iofomo.com) .

## Get Start

### Installation

```shell
$ ./make.sh install
```

### Local Development

```shell
$ ./make.sh start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```shell
$ ./make.sh build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

```shell
GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
